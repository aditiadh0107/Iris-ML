When you find a new flower in a garden, you might look around to see which species it most resembles.If most of its nearest neighbors are Iris-versicolor, you’d probably guess your flower belongs to that species too and say “This is Iris-versicolor,” that’s exactly how the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm works. 
Then imagine you take that same flower and measure its Petal Length and Petal Width. Instead of just saying, “This is Iris-versicolor,” the Logistic Regression model predicts the probability of each species 5% Iris-setosa, 80% Iris-versicolor, and 15% Iris-virginica.
